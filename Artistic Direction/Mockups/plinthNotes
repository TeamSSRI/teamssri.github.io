Colors, etc are on the second image.
This is a mock up, not a final design nor is it in the art style the final will be in.
The idea: You have to get to the plinth. You can walk on the surface, in tunnels (treated as air), on floating platforms, on clouds, and on the sun. There are three teasures in this level, which work as a sort of star/point system.
I can change it to remove the floating platforms in favor of everything being clouds, or better integrating the (trellis? whatever it's called, the slats above the plinth) into the design.
The three facts about the plinth (one associated with each tresure):
- The mist cycles on a 20 minute cycle (source: https://utdmercury.com/when-does-the-plinth-release-mist/ , can double check)
- The plinth lights up at night! [Pixel drawing of the plinth, maybe]
- The plinth often has events going on. A lot of groups will promote their organizations there, and sometimes there are even live concerts! (reword to make less cringe)
