== Cascade Mountain Style Sheet ==
(Rainier is a mountain in the Cascade mountain range, so. pun)

Terms and Defintions: 
- Pixel: As used here, a pixel p refers to a space that the player can see. 
  + Because we're using pixel art, this is going to be drastically different than a pixel on a computer/phone screen.
  + The converstion rate is 1:TBD
- Color palette: The limited range of colors used in a specific piece. I anticipate different color palettes across different levels.
  + Colors will be written in hex format (eg. #A0CDEF) for consistancy and because they translate well to web and digital art. 
  + https://www.colorhexa.com/ is a good website to check colors and readibility. 
  + https://coolors.co/ is a good website for generating color palettes.
- Layer: A scene will have different layers, generally seperated into:
  + Background: Either a solid color or gradient, usually representing the sky. Static across the level.
  + Midground: Things that move, but slowly. Can be multiple layers, eg. clouds, mountains, forest, etc.
  + Foreground: Where the important things happen. This is where the cat, the tokens/trinkets/etc are, and where the meaningful ground is.
  + Ideally, we won't just have layers per scene, but if that's what time allows then that's what time allows. A scene could have:
    = (B)  Background:  a blue/green gradient sky
    = (M1) Midground 1: a layer of clouds
    = (M2) Midground 2: a far layer of mountains
    = (M3) Midground 3: a slightly closer layer of mountains
    = (M4) Midground 4: a layer of trees in a forest
    = (M5) Midground 5: a slightly closer layer of trees in a forest
    = (F)  Foreground:  cat, etc
  + In a sort of layered enviroment, you can use different movement speeds to get a parallax effect that implies depth. Example:
    = (B)  stays constant as the player moves around the screen
    = (M1) moves at a contast pace; it's implied that it's far enough away that it's not affected by player movement
    = (M2) moves at 2p for every 10p of character movement
    = (M3) moves at 3p for every 10p of character movement 
    = (M4) moves at 5p for every 10p of character movement
    = (M5) moves at 6p for every 10p of character movement
    = (F)  moves directly with the character movement
  + Aside from edge cases (the player is literally against the edge of the level), the camera follows the character.
- Scene: What you can see at one point on the screen.
- Level: I'm sure I can come up with a definition, but c'mon. It's a level.
- I'm sure I'll have more pedantic notes that come up later.
